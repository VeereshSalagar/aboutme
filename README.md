# aboutme

This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio website. It showcases my experience, skills, and projects as a Software IV&V Engineer and validation specialist. The site is built with plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript and is designed to be lightweight and responsive.

## Features

- Hero section with animated typing effect and particle background
- Navigation bar with smooth scrolling to sections
- About, Experience, Skills, Projects, and Contact sections
- Downloadable resume link (resume.pdf must be added manually)
- Mobile-friendly layout with glassmorphism design elements

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/VeereshSalagar/aboutme.git
   cd aboutme
   ```
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser. No build steps or dependencies are required.
3. To customize, edit the HTML/CSS/JS files directly.

## Deployment

The site can be hosted on GitHub Pages by enabling Pages in the repo settings (use the `main` branch root). Alternatively, upload the files to any static hosting provider.
